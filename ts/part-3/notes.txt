-Most LLM's follow a completion style of text generation

- completion vs conversational "back and forth messaging" style 

- List of Messages
    - System Message
    - User Message
    - Assistant Message

- A lot of LangChain assumes you are using a completion model
- Memory is used to store data in a Chain
- Used for a ton of stuff, not just storing the list of messages

- LangChain has many kinds of Memory
    - ConversationTokenBufferMemory
    - CombinedMemory
    - ConversationBufferWindowMemory
    - ConversationBufferMemory
